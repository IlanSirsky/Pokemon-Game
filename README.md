## About the Project <a name="About"></a>
This is task 4 in our OOP course.

It is based on our Directed Weighted Graph Tasks we did before on the course. So we used our implementation from the tasks before.
[Ex2 - Directed Weighted Graph - Java](https://github.com/TorNim0s/Directed-Weighted-Grapth) , 
[Ex3 - Directed Weighted Graph - Python](https://github.com/TorNim0s/Directed-Weighted-Graph-Python)

Here we recieve a DW Graph, number of agents and pokemons.
With a mission to "catch" as many pokemons as we can within a given time limit for each stage.

## How to Run <a name="run"></a>
Firstly, to run this project, download the files from the github.

Secondly, Open the cmd in the project folder and write `java -jar Ex4_Server_v0.0.jar 0`, where the last 0 is number of the cases, input a numer between [0-15].

Lastly, run the `Game.py` from your IDE with python 3.9 interpeter.

## Results <a name="results"></a>
Results for the cases we got
|Case|Moves|Grade|Numer of Agents|
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|0|269|147|1|
|1|545|442|1|
|2|273|269|1|
|3|544|644|1|
